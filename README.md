## Tech Stack

- **React.js**: Core framework used to build the user interface.
- **CSS (with custom variables)**: Custom styling, including light and dark mode functionality.
- **Google API**: Integrated to display Google Calendar events.
- **Spotify API**: Integrated to embed a Spotify music player (subject to security restrictions).

## Project Motivation

This app was developed as a way to experiment with React, CSS responsiveness, and UI layout strategies. The goal is to create a support screen layout that helps users focus on their tasks. Although the app serves as a productivity tool, it also provides an opportunity to explore front-end development techniques, particularly with React components and grid-based layouts.

## Limitations

Originally, the app aimed to include features like an embedded email client, personal calendar, Spotify mini-player, and web browser. However, due to security restrictions on embedding these services (related to iframe embedding and cross-origin resource policies), this was discarded.
